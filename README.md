# Systematic Review on ECG & Foundation Models in AI and Bio/Medical Research

This project systematically investigates publications from **top-tier AI conferences** and **Q1 journals** in the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical signal analysis (especially ECG), focusing on **pretrained models, representation learning**, and **few/zero-shot paradigms** from **2018â€“2025**.
